# define ocean and sea generation based on land height and sea level
# define wind based on three-cell circulation theory, season shift, and land height
# define heat absorption based on coordinate, season shift, and local climate
# define evaporation rate based on heat absorption and water level
# define rainfall ratio based on heat absorption (water transferred to lower temperature place is more likely to drop)
# define water transmission rate based on wind and rainfall ratio
# define river and lake generation based on
