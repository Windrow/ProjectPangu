“天地浑沌如鸡子，盘古生其中。万八千岁，天地开辟，阳清为天，阴浊为地。盘古在其中，一日九变，神于天，圣于地。天日高一丈，地日厚一丈，盘古日长一丈，如此万八千岁。天数极高，地数极深，盘古极长，后乃有三皇。数起于一，立于三，成于五，盛于七，处于九，故天去地九万里。”

This is a random world generator which would create an Earth-like world.

Steps towards a random world:

## Cast from Sphere to Grid
- Coordinate
- Cosine correct

## Continental Drift
- Determine the composition of the planet
- How many plate
- How the plates move
- How their relative motion
- Where to raise, where to sink
- How 'raising' and 'sinking' spread further

## Water Coverage
- Mountains, sea level, and oceans
- Three-cell circulation
- Temperature assumption
- Change of season
- Wind, rain, and iced lands
- Finally, we can generate rivers and lakes

## Ecological Communities
- Nature environment based on terrain
- Plants
- Animals
- Resources

## Additional Events
- Earthquake and volcano activities
- Comet strike
- ???

## Born of Intelligent Creatures
- Project Nvwa
